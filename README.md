Phonebook Management System
Overview
The Phonebook Management System is a console-based application developed in Java, designed to manage contact information efficiently. It allows users to add, delete, update, sort, and display contacts through a simple text-based interface. The application utilizes a singly linked list data structure to store and manage contacts dynamically.

Features
Add Contact: Easily add new contacts by entering a name, phone number, and email address.
Delete Contact: Remove existing contacts by specifying the contactâ€™s name.
Update Contact: Modify the phone number of an existing contact.
Sort Contacts: Organize contacts alphabetically by name for better accessibility.
Display All Contacts: View a complete list of all stored contacts in an organized format.
Exit: Safely terminate the application when finished.
Technologies Used
Java: Utilized for developing the core functionality and handling data structures.
Console-Based Interface: Provides a straightforward and user-friendly text-based interaction.
How It Works
The application operates through a simple menu-driven interface, presenting users with various options to manage their contacts. Users interact with the system by entering numerical choices corresponding to different actions. The contacts are stored in a linked list, allowing dynamic addition and removal of contacts without the need for fixed-size storage.

Usage Instructions
Launch the Application: Run the program using a Java-compatible environment.
Navigate the Menu: Upon starting, the user is presented with a menu listing all available actions.
Select an Option: Enter the number corresponding to the desired action (e.g., 1 for adding a contact).
Follow Prompts: For actions like adding or updating contacts, follow the on-screen prompts to input necessary information.
View Results: After each action, the system provides feedback, such as confirmation messages or the updated list of contacts.
Exit the Application: Choose the exit option to safely close the program.
Example Interaction
Adding a Contact: Users can add a new contact by entering the required details when prompted.
Displaying Contacts: Users can view all contacts, which are displayed in an organized manner, showing names, phone numbers, and email addresses.
Sorting Contacts: Users can sort the contact list alphabetically to easily find specific contacts.
Future Enhancements
Data Persistence: Implementing features to save and load contacts from a file to maintain data between sessions.
Enhanced Search: Adding advanced search capabilities to find contacts based on partial matches or multiple criteria.
Input Validation: Improving input validation to ensure the accuracy and reliability of contact information.
